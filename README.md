# Taste-Maker
Recipe finder app 

## User Story
I want to cook something for dinner but I don't know what to cook. With the Taste Maker app I can choose between protein  and cooking style options to decide what to make.
 
 ## Description
 The User can decide between protein and cooking styles to find a wide variety of recipes to try. They can save a list of favorite recipes to reference at a later date and can follow along a youtube video on how to make their desired dish. The User will have a seamless experience getting data from the Spoonacular and YouTube APIs.
